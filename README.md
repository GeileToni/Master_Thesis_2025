# About
This is the full project repository for my Master Thesis, it contains all the code used and developed in the process

# Guide
This repo contains four main directories which all fullfill their own role. To access the report .pdf as well as the 
uncompiled .tex files and used figures go to the "report" directory.

The main chunk of the code used to implement and run all the experiments is written in MATLAB, which can be found in the respective "matlab" folder. It contains multiple packages implementing the functionality and a script folder which contains the main scripts to run the experiments.
