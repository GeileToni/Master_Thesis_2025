    The symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is presented for a second order elliptical problem in 1d which yields a symmetric, positive definite
    bilinear form for a sufficiently positive penalty parameter. This guarantees existence of and uniqueness of the discrete problem. Implementation and theoretical details are discussed.
    Numerical results confirm the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(h^{r+1})$ in the $L^2$-norm.
